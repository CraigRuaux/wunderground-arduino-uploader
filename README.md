Inspired by the Sparkfun weather station project, this code is for an Arduino application that receives weather data from the now-defunct Sparkfun Weather Board (USB Weather Board V3) via XBee, validates the data and then uploads it to Xively. The initial version uploads to Cosm, however it will be changed to Wunderground soon.
